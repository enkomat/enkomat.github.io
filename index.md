## Hey, my name is Matias! Here's a couple of tidbits of info about me. ✨
* 28 and live in Helsinki. Currently in Kallio.
* Studying Computer Science at the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en). Working towards a bachelor's degree.
* Graduated from AEL (renamed to [Taitotalo](https://www.taitotalo.fi)) in 2015.
  * Got a multimedia degree, worked on the graphics for two small 2D game projects and two 3D projects.
  * We used Flash for the 2D projects and Unity for the 3D projects. 3D modeling was done with 3DS Max and the 2D graphics were done with Illustrator, Photoshop and Flash.
  * Skills at making graphics for games a bit rusty at this point, but have been nurturing the idea of getting back into 3D modeling via Blender.
  * Learned the ropes Unity during the 3D projects.
* Have been using Unity since 2014, and been using it to create my own projects since 2015.

## A handful of prototypes I've created with Unity. 👾

### Isomorphic
* iOS puzzle game based on the concept of [graph isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism). Two graphs are isomorphic when they might not visually look similar, but the connections between the nodes are the exact same. This means you could move each of the nodes and make these dissimilar looking graphs the exact same. And that's the premise of the game. Mostly procedurally generated.
* Interestingly, coming up with a good algorithm for checking whether two graphs are isomorphic or not is still a quite active area of computer science.
* Progress: █████████████████▁▁▁ 85%
* A longer gameplay video [here](testurl).

### Zenga
* iOS puzzle game based on the concept of [Eulerian paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path). Basically you need to jot down shapes and not draw too much over whatever you've already drawn. The aesthetic is supposed to be reminiscent of [Zenga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenga) type Japanese ink painting, where the name is derived from.

### Kanuuna
* iOS casual puzzler. You have a given amount of blocks with different colors and the map changes dynamically as you begin to plow through them. If the ball is not the right color, it will bounce off.
* The basic design could be used for something way less casual, but I ended up with this super bright and easily digestable thing. I guess I wanted to try to design something a bit less minimalist and give myself a hall pass to juice everything up to eleven. 😄
* The name means cannon in Finnish.
* Progress: █████████████████▁▁▁ 85%
* A longer gameplay video [here](testurl).

### Pops
* iOS casual puzzler. Your goal is to rotate the 3D shapes on top of each other and then tap to pop them when you match three or more. A spin on the classic Match 3 trope. The design is still pretty messy and there isn't as much depth to it as I'd liked.
* Progress: ███▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁ 15%
* A longer gameplay video [here](testurl).

#### I've sadly yet to finish and release a complete game, but would love to get a shot at it with a good team. Developing solo has definitely been a quest, but I'm pretty sure that at this point it'd be easier to get to the next level doing it the opposite way. Would be stoked to get to work with some more seasoned developers. 🦾

## Random extras and recs. 👀
* Music is near and dear. Have been going at it with various machines - from my home computer to an [SP-1200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mu_SP-1200) - since I was pretty young. Used [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com) for a long time, but switched to [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com) around five years ago.
  * [Goodhertz](https://goodhertz.co) make some of the best audio plugins around. Especially the [Vulf Compressor](https://goodhertz.co/vulf-comp/) is a beast.
  * [Oeksound](https://oeksound.com/) is an amazing Finnish plugin company. [Soothe](https://oeksound.com/plugins/soothe2/) is basically black magic for your mix.
  * [Stompenberg FX](https://www.thomann.de/gb/stompenberg_devices.html) by Thomann. Actual hardware guitar pedals soldered and tampered with, so you can connect to them through the internet and plug them into your own guitar virtually. An interesting writeup about the process [here](https://www.thomann.de/blog/en/stompenberg-effects/).
* Play quite a bit of chess. Got hooked around 2012. 99% of my games have been online, but have played some at the local chess club as well.
  * [Blitztactics](https://blitztactics.com) is a super addictive, fast paced variation on solving tactics.
  * [Lichess](https://lichess.org) a free and opensource alternative to chess.com. Hands down the best place to play online chess.
  * [Aimchess](https://aimchess.com) is great for structured daily drills. Makes getting better a bit less of a Sisyphean ontaking.
* Games and just about all aspects of making a game are obviously things I obsess about. Haven't been playing as much as I'd want to recently, and have a growing list of games I should get to.
  * [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com) by Robert Nystrom is such a masterpiece of an introductory game programming book. An overview of 20 different popular programming patterns with absolutely zero non-essential stuff.
  * [Flow in Games](http://jenovachen.info/abstract) by Jenova Chen is a great read for anyone interested in game design. Gets to the core of one of the biggest reasons people love to play, the flow state.
    * Jenova Chen also directed [Journey](https://store.steampowered.com/app/638230/Journey/), [Flower](https://store.steampowered.com/app/966330/Flower/) and [flOw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(video_game)). All beautiful games in their own right.
* Picked up running and reading again during the pandemic.
   * Goal is to run my first marathon this year. We'll see how that one goes. 😅
   * Another one is to read at least 20 books this year.
     * ████▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁ 20%, 4 books read so far
     * Reading Ray Dalio's Principles and Don Delillo's Zero K at the moment.

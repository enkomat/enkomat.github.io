## Hey, my name is Matias Enkovaara! Here's a couple of tidbits about me. âœ¨
* 28 and live in Helsinki. Currently located at Kallio.
* Studying Computer Science at the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en). Working towards a Bachelor's.
* Graduated from AEL (renamed to [Taitotalo](https://www.taitotalo.fi)) in 2015.
  * Got a multimedia degree, worked on the graphics for two small 2D game projects and two 3D projects.
  * We used Flash for 2D projects and Unity for the 3D projects. 3D modeling was done with 3DS Max and the 2D graphics were done with Illustrator and Photoshop.
  * Skills at making graphics for games a bit rusty at this point, but have been nurturing the idea of getting back into 3D modeling via Blender.
  * Learned the ropes Unity during the 3D projects.
* Have been using Unity since 2014, and been using it to create my own projects since 2015.

## Below are a handful of small projects I've created with Unity. ðŸ‘¾

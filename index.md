## Hey, my name is Matias! Here's a couple of tidbits about me. ✨
* 28 and live in Helsinki. Currently located at Kallio.
* Studying Computer Science at the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en). Working towards a Bachelor's.
* Graduated from AEL (renamed to [Taitotalo](https://www.taitotalo.fi)) in 2015.
  * Got a multimedia degree, worked on the graphics for two small 2D game projects and two 3D projects.
  * We used Flash for the 2D projects and Unity for the 3D projects. 3D modeling was done with 3DS Max and the 2D graphics were done with Illustrator, Photoshop and Flash.
  * Skills at making graphics for games a bit rusty at this point, but have been nurturing the idea of getting back into 3D modeling via Blender.
  * Learned the ropes Unity during the 3D projects.
* Have been using Unity since 2014, and been using it to create my own projects since 2015.

## Below are a handful of small projects I've created with Unity. 👾

## Random extras and recs. 👀
* Love music in all its forms. Have been making music with the computer since I was a kid. Used [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com) for a long time, but switched to [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com) around five years ago. 
  * [Goodhertz](https://goodhertz.co) make some of the best plugins around. Especially the [Vulf Compressor](https://goodhertz.co/vulf-comp/) is a beast.
  * [Oeksound](https://oeksound.com/) is an amazing Finnish plugin company. [Soothe](https://oeksound.com/plugins/soothe2/) is basically black magic.
* Play quite a bit of chess. Got hooked around 2012. 99% of my games have been online, but have played some at the local chess club as well.
  * [Blitztactics](https://blitztactics.com) is a super addictive, fast paced variation on solving tactics.
  * [Lichess](https://lichess.org) a free and opensource alternative to chess.com. Hands down the best place to play online chess.
  * [Aimchess](https://aimchess.com) is great for structured daily drills. Makes getting better a bit less of a Sisyphean ontaking.
* Picked up running and reading again during the pandemic.
   * Running goal is to run a marathon this year. We'll see how that one goes.
   * Reading goal is to read at least 20 books this year.

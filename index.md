## Hey, my name is Matias! Here's a few tidbits of info about me:
* 28 and live in Helsinki. Currently located at Kallio.
* Studying Computer Science at the University of Helsinki. Working towards a Bachelor's.
* Graduated from AEL in 2015.
  * Got a multimedia degree, worked on the graphics for two small 2D game projects and two 3D projects.
  * Skills at making graphics for games a bit rusty at this point, but have been nurturing the idea of getting back into 3D modeling via Blender.
  * Learned the ropes Unity during the 3D projects.
* Have been using Unity since 2014, and have been using it to create my own projects since 2015.

# Here's a couple small projects I've created with Unity. :)

# Also love music in all its forms. Here's a couple tracks I've made. I use Ableton.
